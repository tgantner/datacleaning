##Description of the Tidy Dataset

The original dataset contained a total of 563 variables as follows:

* 561 measurement variables
* 1 variable identifying the subject (1-30)
* 1 variable identifying the activity (1-6)

Of the above, only those pertaining to the mean and standard deviation of each of these measurables (86 variables) and the subject and activity variables (2 variables) were extracted.

The mean of each of the 86 measurement variables was calculated by activity type and subject resulting in a new dataset with 88 columns (86+2) and 180 (30x6) rows.

Furthermore, the activity variable has been transformed into a factor with 6 levels to represent each of the activity types.

Lastly, the original measurement variable names were amended to refer to the mean of these variables and descriptive names were allocated to the subject and activity variables.

Below is a complete list of the variables names in the Tidy Dataset:
